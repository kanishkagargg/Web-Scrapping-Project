# Web Scrapping Project (Justwatch)

I have used the following steps to make this project:

1) Utilized Python with the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping.
2) Targeted the JustWatch website for data extraction.
3) Initially gathered information on movies released between 2018 to 2024.
4) For each movie, collected the following details:

   -Title
   
   -Release year
   
   -Genre
   
   -Production country
   
   -Streaming service provider
   
   -Movie URL
   
   -IMDB rating
   
   -Runtime
   
   -Age ratings
   
6) Employed loops and tags to efficiently extract data.
7) Structured the extracted data into a dataframe for better organization.
8) Repeated the above process for TV shows/series.
9) Filtered the gathered data to include only titles released between 2022-2024 with an IMDb rating of 7 or higher.
10) Conducted analysis on the filtered data, including:
11) Calculated the average IMDb ratings for movies and TV shows separately.
12) Identified the top genres.
13) Determined the most prevalent streaming service provider.
14) Finally, exported the analyzed and filtered data into CSV files for further use.
